# How to use HOC in React?
HOC should always be a pure function. That means that the same enhanced component should always be returned with the same base component passed as a parameter.
Don’t use HOCs inside the render method. This makes React's reconciliation algorithm think that a new component is redeclared within each render, causing the whole subtree to be unmounted rather than just checked for differences.
Static methods do not get copied implicitly. This needs to be done explicit. A good way to do it is with hoist-non-react-statics package.
Refs don’t get passed through.

Since HOCs create a new abstract container component, here is the list of things that you can normally do with them:
Wrap an element or component around a component.
State abstraction.
Manipulate props, e.g. adding new props and modifying or removing existing props.
Props validation to create.
Use refs to access instance methods.
